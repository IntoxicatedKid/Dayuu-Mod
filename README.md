Adds 5+1 Dayuu cards, 1 Dayuu exhibit to the game.
It's more of a joke, practice mod and very unbalanced.
I may not able to fix bugs since i have zero coding knowledge.
You need LBoL-Entity-Sideloader to use this mod.

Installation: Download DayuuMod.dll and place it to Steam\steamapps\common\LBoL\BepInEx\plugins

All credit goes to @neoshrimp_7746, without their framework and tutorials this mod does not exist.

And Dayuu.
